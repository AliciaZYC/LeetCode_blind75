# LeetCode Problem 1: Two Sum

## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return **indices of the two numbers** such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have **exactly one solution**, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

### Example:

```python
Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
Output: [0, 1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 2 + 7 == 9, we return [0, 1].
```

### Constraints:

- `2 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
- `10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
- `10^9 <= target <= 10^9`
- **Only one valid answer exists.**

## Solution Approach

The solution uses a hash map (dictionary) to store the indices of the numbers as we iterate through the list. This approach allows us to check in constant time whether the complement of the current number (i.e., `target - nums[i]`) exists in the hash map.

### Algorithm:

1. Initialize an empty dictionary `numToIndex` to store numbers and their corresponding indices.
2. Iterate through each number in `nums`.
   - If the complement of the current number exists in `numToIndex`, return the indices of the current number and its complement.
   - Otherwise, add the current number and its index to the dictionary.
3. Return the indices of the two numbers when a solution is found.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the input list `nums`. We traverse the list once, and each lookup operation in the hash map takes `O(1)` time on average.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`, as we need to store each number in the hash map.

## Code

Here is the implementation in Python:

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        numToIndex = {}
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if target - nums[i] in numToIndex:
                return [numToIndex[target - nums[i]], i]
            numToIndex[nums[i]] = i
```

### Explanation

- `numToIndex` is used to keep track of the numbers we have seen so far and their indices.
- For each number, we check if its complement (i.e., `target - nums[i]`) is already in `numToIndex`.
  - If it is, that means we found the two numbers that add up to the target, and we return their indices.
  - Otherwise, we add the current number and its index to `numToIndex` for future reference.

### Edge Cases

- The problem guarantees exactly one solution, so there is no need to handle cases where no solution exists.
