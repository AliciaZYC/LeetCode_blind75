# LeetCode Problem 217: Contains Duplicate

## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, return `true` if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return `false` if every element is distinct.

### Example:

```python
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: true
```

```python
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: false
```

```python
Input: nums = [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]
Output: true
```

### Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

## Solution Approach

The simplest way to determine if the array contains duplicates is to use a set. Sets in Python automatically handle duplicate values, so by converting the list to a set, we can easily check if the number of unique elements is less than the total number of elements in the list.

### Algorithm:

1. Convert the list `nums` to a set, which removes duplicate values.
2. Compare the length of the set with the length of the original list.
   - If the lengths are different, it means there are duplicate elements, so return `true`.
   - Otherwise, return `false`.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the input list `nums`. The conversion of the list to a set requires `O(n)` operations.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`, as we need to store the unique elements in the set.

## Code

Here is the implementation in Python:

```python
class Solution:
    def containsDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        return len(set(nums)) != len(nums)
```

### Explanation

- `set(nums)` creates a set from the list `nums`, removing any duplicate values.
- We then compare the length of the set to the length of the original list. If they differ, it means duplicates were present in the list.

### Edge Cases

- If the list contains only one element, the function will always return `false` since there cannot be duplicates.
- If the list is empty, it also returns `false` as there are no elements to compare.
