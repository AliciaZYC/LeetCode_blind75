# LeetCode Problem 121: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

## Problem Statement

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i-th` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

Return the **maximum profit** you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

### Example:

```python
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
```

```python
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done, and the maximum profit = 0
```

### Constraints:

- `1 <= prices.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4`

## Solution Approach

The goal is to find the maximum profit by choosing a day to buy and a day to sell in the future. To do this, we track the minimum price seen so far and compute the current profit for each day as we iterate through the list.

### Algorithm:

1. Initialize `min_price` with the first element of the `prices` list and `max_profit` to `0`.
2. Iterate through each price in the `prices` list:
   - If the current price is less than `min_price`, update `min_price`.
   - Calculate the current profit by subtracting `min_price` from the current price.
   - If the current profit is greater than `max_profit`, update `max_profit`.
3. Return the `max_profit` after traversing all the prices.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the input list `prices`. We only make a single pass through the list.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`, since we only use a few variables to keep track of the minimum price and maximum profit.

## Code

Here is the implementation in Python:

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        min_price = prices[0]
        max_profit = 0
        for price in prices:
            if price < min_price:
                min_price = price
            current_profit = price - min_price
            if current_profit > max_profit:
                max_profit = current_profit
        return max_profit
```

### Explanation

- We initialize `min_price` with the first stock price because that's the lowest price we have seen so far.
- For each price, we update `min_price` if the current price is lower.
- We then compute the potential profit if we were to sell at the current price.
- If this potential profit is greater than the maximum profit recorded so far, we update `max_profit`.

### Edge Cases

- If the prices are in decreasing order, we will return `0` since no profit can be made.
